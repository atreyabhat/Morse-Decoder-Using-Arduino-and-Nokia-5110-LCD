# Morse-Decoder-Using-Arduino-and-Nokia-5110-LCD
A project and code to accept morse code and display decoded message on LCD

I have Used Arduino Uno , Nokia 5110, LED matrix 8x8, a Push Button Switch for Input of Morse Code
The LED matrix is only used to confirm the input is Dash or Dot and is Optional.
The Circuit Connections are Mentioned in the Arduino Code

Thank You
